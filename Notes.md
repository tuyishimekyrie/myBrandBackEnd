To run the npm ts-jest config:init command as a TypeScript engineer, you need to ensure you have ts-jest installed in your project's dependencies. If not, you can install it using npm or yarn:

npm install --save-dev ts-jest

npm i supertest jest ts-jest @types/jest @types/supertest -D

Once ts-jest is installed, you can initialize its configuration by running:

The npx command is used to execute packages that aren't globally installed. It will automatically look for ts-jest in your node_modules and execute it. This command will generate a jest.config.js file with some default configurations for TypeScript.

npmx ts-jest config:init
